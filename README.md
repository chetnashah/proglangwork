### Von neumann architechture

design architecture for an electronic digital computer with these components:

1. A processing unit with both an arithmetic logic unit and processor registers
2. A control unit that includes an instruction register and a program counter
3. Memory that stores data and instructions
4. External mass storage
5. Input and output mechanisms

An important charechteristic is how cpu operates:
1. fetch
2. decode
3. execute
4. write-back

### von neuman languages

assignment based operations (interacting with a store state & time & sequential order of execution of instruction)

The isomorphism between von Neumann programming languages and architectures is in the following manner:

1. program variables ↔ computer storage cells
2. control statements ↔ computer test-and-jump instructions
3. assignment statements ↔ fetching, storing instructions
4. expressions ↔ memory reference and arithmetic instructions.
